# graduation project

This repo, was created to store my python code.
And the code, was to draw a figure.
The the figure, was used in my graduation paper
So, you know. Maybe this is the last time I use python. Using python, emmm, I think it not comfortable.
Finally, as a CS student, my coding life was done.
Have a nice future, me and everyone.
